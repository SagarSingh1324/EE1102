
ERRORS and their CORRECTIONS:

1. Main function was not defined, defined main function.

2. Data type of rate of interest was not defined, defined float r.

3. No ; after scanning p, put ; there.

3. Data type of time is int but as t/365 can take 
non integer values so right  data type would be float.

4. No braces around r/100, put braces there to preserve order.
 
5. Added + p in maturity formula which was missing.
